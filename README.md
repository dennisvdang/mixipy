mixipy is a Python library that provides a Pythonic interface to the audio processing capabilities of the open-source Mixxx project. It wraps Mixxx's C++ codebase, enabling Python developers to leverage advanced audio analysis, manipulation, and mixing features.

## Features

- Clean and intuitive Python API for common audio tasks
- Comprehensive functionality: audio I/O, signal processing, feature extraction, beat detection
- Optimized for performance by utilizing the C++ core
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Detailed documentation, examples, and tutorials

## Installation

You can install mixipy using pip:

```bash
pip install mixipy

## Usage

Here's a simple example of using mixipy to load an audio file and detect beats:

```python
import mixipy

# Load an audio file
audio, sr = mixipy.audio.load("path/to/audio.wav")

# Detect beats
beats = mixipy.beat.detect_beats(audio, sr)

# Print the detected beat timestamps
print("Detected beats:")
for beat in beats:
    print(beat)
```python
